2. Start the Rails server:

- When you try to create an account it will default to role of tenant, so you won't be able to see much when logging in (only view accessiblity).
- Only role of landlords has permissions to create,edit,update and delete data.
- You will need admin (owner of app) to change your role in order to be a landlord.

### Coding Conventions
We adhere to the Ruby community style guide, and we expect all contributors to follow suit. Here are key conventions specific to our project:

- **Code Style**: Follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/), which provides detailed guidelines on the coding style preferred by the Ruby community.
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Use `snake_case` for variables, methods, and file names.
  - Use `PascalCase` for class and module names.
  - Reflect domain concepts accurately in naming. For instance, if you are working within a financial application, prefer names like `user_account_details` over vague terms like `data`.

- **Design Principles**: Focus on Domain-Driven Design (DDD):
  - Organize code to reflect the domain model clearly.
  - Use service objects, decorators, and other design patterns that help isolate domain logic from application logic.

### Comments and Documentation
- **Comment your code** where necessary to explain "why" something is done, not "what" is done‚Äîsource code should be self-explanatory regarding the "what".
- **Document methods and classes** thoroughly, focusing on their roles within the domain model, especially for public APIs.

### Version Control Practices
- Commit messages should be clear and follow best practices, such as those outlined in [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- Keep commits focused on a single issue to simplify future maintenance and troubleshooting.

### Branch Naming Conventions
Please use the following naming conventions for your branches:

- `<issue#-initals-description>` (i.e 31-kc-added-pagination)

### Pull Request Process
1. **Creating a Pull Request**: Provide a detailed PR description, referencing the issue it addresses.
2. **Review Process**: PRs require review from at least one maintainer.
